# UESigPatch
UESigPatch is an ASI plugin with the intent of patching signature checks and subsequently enabling content mods for an increasing number of Unreal Engine 4/5 games, based on the incredible work of [@thethiny](https://github.com/thethiny).

### Instructions:
Clone the repository and compile the solution in Visual Studio 2022. Prebuilt releases may be provided at a later date. Once compiled, the resulting ASI should be injected into supported Unreal games using a supported injector, with [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader) in particular being recommended.

### Supported Games:
 - Bramble: The Mountain King
 - Mortal Kombat 1
 - Sifu
