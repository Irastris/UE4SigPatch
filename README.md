# UESigPatch
UESigPatch is an ASI plugin with the intent of patching signature checks and subsequently enabling content mods for an increasing number of Unreal Engine 4/5 games, based on the incredible work of [@thethiny](https://github.com/thethiny).

### Instructions:
Download the compiled ASI from the [latest release](https://github.com/Irastris/UESigPatch/releases/latest), or clone the repository and compile the solution in Visual Studio 2022. To utilize, the ASI should be injected into supported Unreal games using an ASI injector, this repo recommends [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader).

### Supported Games:
 - Bramble: The Mountain King
 - Mortal Kombat 1 (by [@thethiny](https://github.com/thethiny))
 - Sifu
